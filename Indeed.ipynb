       "\"Data Science is a broad field at NSA and a team effort that spans all the expertise needed to derive value from data. As a Data Scientist, you will uses elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and application-specific knowledge to gather, make, and communicate principled conclusions from data. You will employ your mathematical science, computer science, and quantitative analysis skills to develop solutions to complex data problems and take full advantage of NSA's capabilities to tackle the highest priority challenges. Responsibilities include: - Exploring data analysis and model-fitting to reveal data features of interest - Using the machine-learned predictive modeling - Constructing usable data sets from multiple sources to meet customer needs - Identifying and analyzing anomalous data (including metadata) - Developing conceptual design and models to address mission requirements - Developing qualitative and quantitative methods for characterizing datasets in various states - Performing analytic modeling, scripting, and/or programming - Working collaboratively and iteratively throughout the data-science lifecycle - Designing and developing analytics and techniques for analysis - Analyzing data using mathematical and statistical methods - Evaluating, documenting, and communicating research processes, analyses, and results to customers, peers, and leadership - Creating interpretable visualizations\""
